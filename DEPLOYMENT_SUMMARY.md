## 🎯 Recommended Interview Talking Points

1. **Data Engineering Challenge:**
   - "The Saudi production data was annual, so I implemented forward-fill resampling to create monthly estimates while preserving the underlying patterns."

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - "I engineered 73 features from 7 base variables using lags (1-12 months) and rolling statistics (3, 6, 12 month windows) to capture temporal dependencies."

3. **Model Selection:**
   - "I compared 4 models using time-series cross-validation. LightGBM won with RMSE of 2.88 MBPD at 1-month horizon, balancing accuracy and interpretability."

4. **Explainability:**
   - "Used SHAP values to show that Brent price explains ~35-40% of variance, with a non-linear elasticity of ~2-3% production increase per 10% price increase."

5. **Deployment Strategy:**
   - "Built a complete MLOps pipeline: MLflow for experiment tracking, FastAPI for serving, Streamlit for visualization, and Docker for reproducible deployment."

6. **Testing Philosophy:**
   - "Focused on testing the core data pipeline with 10 unit tests covering loaders and transforms, ensuring data quality before model training."
