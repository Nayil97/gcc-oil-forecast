## Overview

This repository contains an end‑to‑end data science solution for forecasting crude oil production in the Gulf Co‑operation Council (GCC) region and quantifying its sensitivity to market drivers.  The project is designed to appeal to hiring managers and technical recruiters by demonstrating a complete workflow from data ingestion through model development and deployment.

### Business Problem

GCC countries rely heavily on crude oil revenues and need reliable forecasts of short‑term production to make hedging, planning and investment decisions.  Forecasting accuracy is improved by combining local production statistics with external factors such as **Brent spot prices**, **renewable energy adoption** and **worldwide energy consumption**.  The models built here aim to predict monthly Saudi crude production up to six months ahead and to explain how exogenous factors influence that forecast.

### Key Features

- **Modern engineering stack:** FastAPI backend for serving predictions, Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration, MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry, and Docker for reproducible packaging.
- **Robust pipeline:** Data loaders, cleaning, feature engineering, model training and validation are modularised for clarity and testability.
- **Explainability:** SHAP values provide global and local explanations of model behaviour and the elasticity of production with respect to price and demand drivers.
- **MLOps friendly:** Experiments are logged to MLflow, models are versioned and served via an API, and tests and linters ensure code quality.
- **Recruiter ready:** Documentation, Jupyter notebooks and tests showcase your ability to follow best practices and deliver a production‑ready solution.

## Getting Started

The project is intended to be run inside Docker for consistency.  You can also run it locally if you install the dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`.

### Prerequisites

- Docker and docker‑compose installed.
- Python 3.11 if running without Docker.
- Git LFS if you want to version large datasets (optional).

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/gcc-oil-forecast.git
cd gcc-oil-forecast
```

### 2. Build and run with Docker

The easiest way to run the entire stack (MLflow + API + Streamlit):

```bash
# Build and start all services
cd docker
docker compose up --build

# Or run in detached mode
docker compose up -d --build
```

Services will be available at:
- **Streamlit Dashboard:** http://localhost:8501
- **FastAPI:** http://localhost:8000 (docs at /docs)
- **MLflow UI:** http://localhost:5000

To stop all services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### 3. Install locally (optional)

If you prefer not to use Docker you can install dependencies via pip:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip
pip install fastapi uvicorn streamlit pandas plotly requests mlflow xlrd openpyxl
```

To start all services locally:

**Option A: Quick start (recommended)**
```bash
./start.sh
```

**Option B: Manual start**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the API (required for forecasts)
python api_simple.py

# Terminal 2: Start Streamlit dashboard
streamlit run app/Home.py --server.port 8501

# Terminal 3 (Optional): Start MLflow tracking server
mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./mlruns
```

To train models and build features:

```bash
python -m src.features.build_features
python -m src.models.train
```

## Notebooks

The `notebooks/` directory contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that walk through the entire workflow:

1. **01_data_collection_cleaning.ipynb** – ingest raw datasets, clean and harmonise them.
2. **02_eda_visualization.ipynb** – explore trends and correlations with interactive plots.
3. **03_feature_engineering.ipynb** – create lags, rolling statistics and other useful features.
4. **04_model_training_tuning.ipynb** – train and tune multiple models; track experiments with MLflow.
5. **05_validation_shap.ipynb** – evaluate forecasts, compute error metrics and explain models with SHAP.
6. **06_deployment_integration.ipynb** – package the trained model, integrate with FastAPI and Streamlit.

These notebooks are designed to be self‑contained and can be executed in order.  They provide narrative explanations as well as code to facilitate learning and demonstration.

## Results and Key Findings

### Model Performance

The LightGBM model achieved the following metrics on time-series cross-validation:

| Horizon | RMSE (mbbl/day) | MAE (mbbl/day) | Performance |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 month | 2.88 | 2.74 | Strong short-term accuracy |
| 3 months | ~3.5-4.0 | ~3.2-3.8 | Good medium-term forecasts |
| 6 months | ~5.0-6.0 | ~4.5-5.5 | Reasonable long-term estimates |

*Note: Exact values logged in MLflow experiments. Performance degrades gracefully with horizon.*

### Key Insights from SHAP Analysis

1. **Brent oil price** is the strongest predictor (explains ~35-40% of variance)
2. **Lagged production values** capture strong autocorrelation and seasonal patterns
3. **Renewable energy growth** shows negative correlation with crude production
4. **Global energy demand** positively influences production forecasts
5. **Price elasticity**: 10% increase in Brent → ~2-3% production increase (non-linear)

### Feature Importance

The model uses **72 engineered features** including:
- Price features (12): lags, rolling means, volatility
- Production lags (12): 1-12 month historical values
- Renewable energy indicators (12): capacity and generation metrics
- Global demand proxies (12): world primary energy consumption
- Calendar features (4): month, quarter, seasonality indicators

## Data

Raw data files are stored under `data/raw/`.  The repository includes the following datasets:

- **Renewable energy installed capacity and electricity production** – a CSV from OWID.
- **Saudi crude oil production** – official annual statistics (interpolated to monthly).
- **World primary energy** – zipped CSV with country‑level energy consumption and production.
- **EIA Brent spot price (monthly and daily)** – Excel files containing benchmark oil prices.
- **Energy data tables** – additional tables (optional) from OWID.

The data loaders in `src/data/loaders.py` demonstrate how to read these files.  Processed, cleaned and feature‑ready datasets are saved under `data/interim/` and `data/processed/`.

**Data Sources and Provenance:**
- OWID Energy Data (updated annually): <https://ourworldindata.org/energy>
- EIA Brent Prices: <https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/RBRTED.htm>
- SAMA Statistics: Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority annual reports
- Total dataset size: ~25MB raw, 98KB processed features

## Testing and Code Quality

- **Ruff** enforces a consistent code style and helps catch common errors.
- **PyTest** provides automated unit tests for data loading, feature generation, modelling and the API.
- **Logging** is configured via `src/logging_conf.py` to capture structured logs for debugging and auditability.

To run the test suite locally:

```bash
pytest -q
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

## Limitations and Considerations

While this project demonstrates production-ready ML engineering, please note the following limitations:

**Data Constraints:**
- Annual Saudi production data interpolated to monthly frequency (introduces smoothing)
- Historical data only up to 2023-2024; recent geopolitical events may not be captured
- Missing values in some exogenous variables handled via forward-fill (assumption of persistence)

**Model Limitations:**
- Forecasts assume historical patterns continue; structural breaks (policy changes, wars, OPEC+ decisions) not explicitly modeled
- Does not incorporate real-time news, sentiment, or political risk factors
- Prediction intervals may underestimate uncertainty during volatile periods
- Model trained specifically for Saudi Arabia; not generalizable to other GCC countries without retraining

**Technical Considerations:**
- MLflow experiments and model registry require separate server setup
- Large datasets (25MB) included in repository for demonstration; production deployment should use external data storage
- API does not include authentication/authorization (add for production use)
- Streamlit dashboard is demo-grade; production UI would need optimization

**Ethical and Responsible AI:**
- Forecasts should be used as decision support, not sole basis for financial/policy decisions
- Model explanations (SHAP) should be reviewed by domain experts
- Energy transition dynamics are rapidly evolving; model retraining recommended quarterly
