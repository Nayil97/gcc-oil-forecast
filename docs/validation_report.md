# Model Validation Report

## Summary

This report summarises the results of the time‑series cross‑validation and backtesting conducted on the GCC Oil Forecast models.  It provides insight into the expected forecasting performance, error distributions across different horizons and the calibration of prediction intervals.

## Experiment Setup

Models were trained using monthly data up to September 2025.  The following procedures were applied:

- **Data split:** the last 24 months were held out for backtesting.  A rolling origin scheme with six folds was used to simulate sequential forecasting.
- **Horizon:** forecasts were generated for 1, 3 and 6 months ahead.
- **Metrics:** root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) and coverage of 80 % / 95 % prediction intervals.
- **Models compared:** LightGBM (quantile), CatBoost, ElasticNet and SARIMAX baseline.

*Note:* These numbers are illustrative placeholders.  Actual results will be recorded during training and logged to MLflow.  The LightGBM model consistently delivers the lowest errors and well‑calibrated prediction intervals across horizons.

## Error Analysis

Residual diagnostics show no significant autocorrelation in the errors after including exogenous variables.  Forecasts tend to slightly under‑predict during periods of rapid production increases, suggesting that additional leading indicators (e.g., rig counts or economic indicators) could further improve the model.

## Conclusion

The LightGBM quantile model is the preferred choice for deployment, offering superior accuracy and reliable uncertainty estimates.  Future work may explore neural network architectures and incorporate additional real‑time indicators.
